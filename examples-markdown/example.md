# INTRODUCTION
sanity
We are mining github repositoryies, cause they are cool to mine and we like uhm get diffs and uhm get like bugs and diffs and bugs we like map with stats and cool stuff to make cool matrix that we then use so other people can use our data set to find cool solutions to bugs and what patches fix which bugs and stuff. Man, this is the future bruh. 
<br>
here we have some cool python code
```python
def foo():
 return "bar"
```

imagine if we could do math and stuff

$$
f(a)={\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\oint _{\gamma }{\frac {f(z)}{z-a}}\,dz
\tag{1}
\label{1}
$$

look at this cool referece duuude @my_article
